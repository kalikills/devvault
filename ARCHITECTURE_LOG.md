# DevVault — BUILD LOG

## Project Vision
DevVault is a professional-grade Python CLI designed to help developers identify, protect, and back up development projects with safety-first architecture.

### Core Philosophy
- Safety over speed  
- Predictability over cleverness  
- Atomic operations  
- Calm, trust-building UX  
- Failure-aware design  
- Minimal cognitive load  

DevVault is engineered to behave like a reliability system, not a script.

---

# Phase 1 — Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

## Repository Initialization
- Structured Python project layout
- Added `.gitignore`
- Adopted per-project virtual environments (`.venv`)
- Established clean repository practices

---

## Scanner Engine
Recursive project scanner capable of detecting development environments via:

- `.git`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `package.json`
- `requirements.txt`
- `Cargo.toml`
- `go.mod`

### Capabilities
- Depth-limited traversal  
- Directory skip logic  
- Permission-safe scanning  
- Metadata collection:
  - last modified
  - project size
  - git presence
  - README detection
  - test detection

---

## Reporting System
### CLI Output
- Structured terminal report  
- Backup size estimation  
- Recommended drive sizing  
- Risk warnings  

### JSON Output
Enables automation and future integrations.

---

## Risk Detection
Flags:
- Projects without git  
- Missing documentation  
- Missing tests  

Designed to surface silent operational risks early.

---

## CLI Packaging
Installed via:

pip install -e .

Exposes command:

devvault

Supports:
- root scanning
- JSON output
- filtering
- file output

---

# Phase 2 — Architecture & Safety Infrastructure (ACTIVE)

## Snapshot Engine ✅ COMPLETE
Major reliability milestone.

Implemented timestamped snapshot directories:

DevVault/
  snapshots/
    YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/

### Atomic Snapshot Pattern
Snapshots are never trusted until finalized.

Write Phase:
.incomplete-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS

Commit Phase:
YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS

Prevents false backups during interruption.

---

## Core Snapshot Functions
- create_snapshot_root()
- commit_snapshot()

Includes defensive validation.

---

# Architectural Principles Established

## Guardrails Over Freedom
Unsafe backup locations are blocked.

False safety is worse than tool failure.

---

## Calm Failure UX
Errors must:
- lead softly  
- explain clearly  
- reassure  
- provide recovery steps  

DevVault should feel stable — never chaotic.

---

## Predictive Safety
Backups estimate required disk space BEFORE execution.

Users should never be surprised by disk failures.

---

## Quiet Guardian Behavior
Surface critical safety signals without becoming noisy.

---

## Verification Philosophy
Backups must be verified — not assumed.

Initial strategy:
- file existence  
- size matching  

Future path:
- checksum validation  

---

# Developer Workflow Standards

## One Virtual Environment Per Project
Prevents dependency conflicts.

Disk is cheap.  
Broken environments are expensive.

---

## Standardized Backup Root
External drives always use:

DevVault/

No custom naming — improves disaster recovery clarity.

---

# Major Builder Milestones

✅ First real filesystem modification  
✅ Cross-WSL → Windows path success  
✅ Infrastructure-level safety patterns implemented  
✅ Transition from scripting → system design  

DevVault is no longer a prototype.

---

# Architecture Checkpoint — 2026-02-03
Phase 1 Architecture Finalized

- Separated CLI from engine
- Introduced typed ScanResult
- Engine returns structured data
- Added quiet mode
- Enforced JSON CLI contract
- Removed argparse from engine
- Stabilized repository

Engineering Rules:
- Switch chats only at safe architectural checkpoints  
- ALWAYS update BUILD_LOG before ending a session  

---

# Architecture Checkpoint — 2026-02-04
Phase 2 Boundary Enforcement

Engine:
- Introduced typed ScanRequest
- Added pure scan(req)
- Removed run_scan
- Eliminated formatting from engine

CLI:
- Moved formatting to devvault/formatters.py
- CLI owns stdout + file output

Structural Fixes:
- Resolved scanner.models collision
- Removed accidental scaffolding

---

## Testing Infrastructure Added
- Unit tests for scan() using TemporaryDirectory
- Established refactor safety net

---

## Dependency Injection Initiated
- Introduced FileSystemPort
- Added OSFileSystem adapter
- Began filesystem injection into engine

This marks DevVault’s transition toward clean architecture.

---

# Current Project State

DevVault now has:

✅ layered architecture  
✅ typed engine contracts  
✅ pure domain logic  
✅ CLI isolation  
✅ unit tests  
✅ atomic reliability patterns  

---

# Next Architectural Target

👉 Filesystem Port Migration

Refactor engine internals to operate entirely through injected filesystem interfaces.

Unlocks:

- deterministic tests  
- mock filesystems  
- parallel scanning  
- remote adapters  
- cloud backup support  

---

## Status

DevVault has successfully crossed from project → system design.

- Began filesystem migration: injected FileSystemPort into scan_roots, passed fs from scan(), and migrated directory iteration to fs.iterdir() (green tests)
- Filesystem migration: scan_roots now uses FileSystemPort for root exists/is_dir checks (tests green)
- Filesystem migration: is_project_dir now accepts FileSystemPort and scan_roots passes fs through (tests green)
- Filesystem migration: moved .git detection to FileSystemPort (fs.is_dir), further reducing engine OS coupling (tests green)
- Filesystem migration: replaced project marker `.is_file()` checks with fs.exists(), continuing engine decoupling from OS (tests green)
- Filesystem migration: moved dir_path mtime retrieval to fs.stat(dir_path).st_mtime (tests green)
- Filesystem migration: injected FileSystemPort into dir_size_bytes and migrated iteration to fs.iterdir() (tests green)
- Filesystem migration: dir_size_bytes now uses fs.is_dir() for directory checks (tests green)
- Filesystem migration: dir_size_bytes now uses fs.stat(entry).st_size for file sizing (tests green)
- Filesystem migration: migrated README detection to FileSystemPort (fs.exists) during FoundProject metadata build (tests green)
- Filesystem migration: migrated test folder detection to FileSystemPort (fs.exists) during FoundProject metadata build (tests green)
- Filesystem migration: migrated git presence metadata to FileSystemPort (fs.exists) during FoundProject build (tests green)

- FilesystemPort migration milestone: scanner engine now routes traversal, existence checks, and metadata/stat access through FileSystemPort (iterdir/exists/is_dir/stat). This decouples core scan logic from the OS filesystem while keeping tests green.

## 2026-02-04 — Filesystem adapter completed + tests green
- Implemented OSFileSystem adapter methods needed by scan + backup engines (mkdir, exists, is_dir, iterdir, stat, is_file, read_text).
- Resolved terminal paste/overwrite corruption by clean rewrite of scanner/adapters/filesystem.py.
- Test status: python -m pytest -q → 6 passed.

# Architecture Checkpoint — 2026-02-04
Backup Engine Foundation + Filesystem Port Completion

## Filesystem Layer
- Expanded FileSystemPort to support engine needs (mkdir, exists, is_dir, is_file, iterdir, stat, read_text).
- Stabilized OSFileSystem adapter.
- Restored scan engine compatibility after port expansion.

## Backup Engine
- Introduced BackupEngine with plan → execute orchestration shape.
- Enforced dependency injection through FileSystemPort.
- Maintained CLI isolation (no printing from engine).

## Testing
- Added backup engine tests.
- Full suite passing: 6 tests green.

## Architectural Impact
This checkpoint finalizes filesystem abstraction and establishes the execution shape for DevVault backups.

DevVault continues its transition from tool → reliability system.


## 2026-02-05T02:18:58Z — Phase 2: Real copy into incomplete backup directory

- BackupEngine now copies the contents of `source_root` into `.incomplete-<backup_id>` before finalize.
- Atomic finalize preserved: rename `.incomplete-*` → final backup directory after copy completes.
- FileSystemPort explicitly includes `rename` and adds `copy_file`.
- OSFileSystem implements streamed binary copy via `shutil.copyfileobj` (1 MiB chunks).
- Safety-first: only directories + regular files copied; special filesystem nodes skipped for now.
- Tests: added real-file copy test; suite green.

## 2026-02-05T02:32:27Z — Phase 2.5: Manifest Added

- Backup engine now writes manifest.json inside .incomplete before finalize.
- Manifest records relative file paths and sizes.
- Final backups are now self-describing artifacts.
- Atomic invariant strengthened: copy → manifest → rename.


## 2026-02-05T02:36:51Z — Phase 2.5: Backup manifest + failure-safety invariant

- Backups now include `manifest.json` written inside `.incomplete-*` before finalize.
- Manifest currently records copied regular files with relative paths and sizes.
- Safety invariant: if manifest write fails, backup is not finalized; `.incomplete-*` remains for inspection/retry.
- Copy → manifest → rename remains the atomic flow; finalized backups are self-describing.

## 2026-02-05T02:57:25Z — Symlink policy (safety boundary)

- Established policy: symlinks are not copied and are not listed as files in the manifest.
- FileSystemPort includes `is_symlink`; OSFileSystem implements it using `Path.is_symlink()`.
- Tests enforce that a symlink-to-file does not appear in backup output or manifest.


# Architecture Checkpoint — Restore Engine + Boundary Enforcement

## Restore Capability Added
- Implemented RestoreEngine with FileSystemPort injection.
- Enforced safety invariant: destination must be empty.
- Refuses restore from `.incomplete-*` snapshots.
- Validates manifest before restore begins.

## Disaster Recovery Proven
- Added round-trip test: backup → restore → byte verification.
- DevVault artifacts are now confirmed recoverable.

## Filesystem Boundary Hardened
- Added `write_text` to FileSystemPort.
- Updated OSFileSystem adapter.
- Routed manifest writes through the port.
- Eliminated direct Path write inside engine.

## Architectural Impact
DevVault now supports the full backup lifecycle:

scan → snapshot → manifest → finalize → **restore**

This marks DevVault’s transition from backup utility → reliability system.


## Addendum — Restore Safety Guardrails
- Added test enforcing invariant: restore refuses non-empty destination.
- Protects against accidental overwrite/merge restores during future refactors.


## Addendum — Restore Preflight + Artifact Validation
- Restore now performs full preflight validation before writing any destination data.
- Refuses unsafe manifest paths (absolute or traversal via `..`).
- Validates snapshot integrity via existence + size matching against manifest.
- Ensures fail-closed behavior: invalid manifests do not create/modify destination directories.


## 2026-02 — Manifest v2 + Verified Restore

### Integrity Upgrade
DevVault now implements end-to-end backup verification.

Key guarantees:

- Backups emit Manifest v2
    - manifest_version = 2
    - checksum_algo = sha256
    - per-file digest_hex

- Restore performs atomic verification:
    copy → hash → verify → rename

- Corrupted files are NEVER promoted.

- Failed restores perform best-effort temp cleanup.

### Architectural Impact
This establishes DevVault's first **data trust boundary**.

The system no longer assumes backups are valid — it proves they are.

### Compatibility
- Manifest v1 remains restorable (size-validated).
- Manifest v2 enables cryptographic verification.

### Filesystem Boundary
Checksum reads and cleanup operations remain fully enforced through FileSystemPort.

No engine layer performs direct filesystem access.

### Result
DevVault transitions from "backup tool" → **verification-capable backup engine**.
