# DevVault — Project Status

## Classification
Trust infrastructure for irreplaceable digital work.

Not a convenience backup tool.

---

## Current Maturity
**Stability Stage → Entering Reliability Phase**

Core engine behavior is now safety-oriented and fail-closed.

---

## Proven Safety Capabilities

- Atomic snapshot pipeline
- Manifest integrity verification
- Verified restore path
- Vault health gating
- Desktop fail-closed vault enforcement
- Preflight visibility before execution
- **Capacity fail-closed enforcement (NEW)**

Backups are physically prevented when vault space cannot sustain the snapshot.

This eliminates partial-backup risk — one of the most common causes of false confidence.

---

## Architecture Posture
System behavior prioritizes:

- Safety over speed  
- Refusal over corruption  
- Predictability over convenience  

Trust is treated as the primary product.

---

## Next Phase
**Reliability Hardening**

Focus areas:

- restore trust guarantees  
- destructive scenario validation  
- snapshot compatibility confidence  
- operational trust reinforcement  

DevVault is transitioning from strong architecture → dependable safety system.
